Git Upstream
============
When you make changes, you usually want to send them back "upstream" so they make it into that repository so that everyone pulling from the same source is working with all the same changes. 

Git Upstream usually refers to activity that moves in direction of the externally-hosted repository, and Git Downstream would be the reverse (cloning/ downloading.)
